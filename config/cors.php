    |
    | Here you may configure your settings for cross-origin resource sharing
    | or "CORS". This determines what cross-origin operations may execute
    | in web browsers. You are free to adjust these settings as needed.
    |
    | CURRENT CONFIG: ALLOWS ALL ORIGINS (*)
    | This is permissive and allows any domain to access your API.
    | Good for development and testing, but consider restricting in production.
